I have been a web designer for more than fourteen years and have been working in Drupal, a content management system, for about seven. Drupal immersed me in the world of structured data and solving problems that was more interesting, challenging and rewarding than anything I had ever experienced before in my field. Via Drupal's front-facing interface tools, I learned to create programs that solved internal business and external client needs. Now I would like to do that with back and front-end programming skills and take it to the next level. I have heard that pattern recognition is important for developers. I think I have a strong ability to recognize patterns and leverage that ability in my work. The interesting thing about patterns is that they may seem simple at first, and depending on your perspective at the time - they can be but when you take them apart or analyze each cell, they have a myriad of possibilities. Their simplistic complexity is beautiful.


The first time I found myself interested in software development was in 2014 at a technology event being hosted at the United Nations. The UN's Assistant Secretary-General and CIO, Atefeh Riaz, delivered a keynote address in which she challenged the tech audience to think, question, and create innovative technology solutions that address the tough human issues we face today. Her presentation was followed by an all-female panel discussing the barriers for women in Tech and encouraging us to push past them. That afternoon I heard two compelling topics that have strongly impacted me - software for humanity and women breaking through the glass ceiling. However, I walked out thinking that it just wasn't a reality I would ever see and felt disappointed. Little did I know that the next few years would lay the ground work me to do just that and to be ready for when the opportunity did present itself.

Why am studying software development? Because I can and because I love it.
